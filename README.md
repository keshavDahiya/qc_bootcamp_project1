# Grover adaptive serach based multivariable boolean function optimization

We implement the grover adaptiver search based optimization of interger-valued boolean functions in $n$ varialbes.

The code and its complexity analysis is orgainzes as follows:

  1. The file QC_MP1_gates.py contains implementation of all the basic gates used. The gates are implemented only using mcx and $1$-qubit gates, namely Hadamard and the phase gates, and possible ancillas in some cases.
  2. The file QC_MP1_marker.py contains the implementation of the marker-oracle and function-encoding routines.
  3. The file QC Mini Project1.ipynb
  4. The file complexity analysis.pdf
